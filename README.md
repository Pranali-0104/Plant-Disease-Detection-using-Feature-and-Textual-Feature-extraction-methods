Repository Description:
Plant Disease Detection using Feature and Textual Feature Extraction

This repository presents a comprehensive solution for accurately detecting plant diseases through a combination of visual and textual feature extraction techniques.

Key Features:

- Visual Feature Extraction: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their advanced variants, such as Region-based CNN (RCNN) and Faster RCNN, to effectively identify and analyze visual characteristics of plant leaves and other relevant parts.
- Textual Feature Extraction: Employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to extract meaningful information from textual data, such as disease descriptions, symptoms, or user-provided inputs.
- Integration with Mobile App: The developed model is seamlessly integrated into a mobile application built using Kotlin. This user-friendly interface allows for easy disease detection and provides valuable recommendations.
- Complete Project Access: The repository includes a link to the ApnaKhet.txt file, which contains detailed information and access to the complete project, including code, data, and documentation.
  
By leveraging the power of deep learning and NLP, this repository offers a robust and efficient approach to plant disease detection, enabling farmers and agricultural experts to take timely preventive measures and protect their crops.
